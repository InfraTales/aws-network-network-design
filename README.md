## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

- CIDR block sizing for future growth
- Transit Gateway cost vs VPC peering
- IPv4 exhaustion planning

> For the full reasoning behind each decision — cost models, alternatives considered, and what breaks at scale — see the **[Full Guide on InfraTales](https://infratales.com/)**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
node >= 18
npm >= 9
aws-cdk >= 2.x
AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
```

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InfraTales/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
npm install
```

### Bootstrap (first time per account/region)

```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_REGION
```

---

## 📦 Deployment

```bash
# Review what will be created
cdk diff --context env=dev

# Deploy to dev
cdk deploy --context env=dev

# Deploy to production (requires broadening approval)
cdk deploy --context env=prod --require-approval broadening
```

> ⚠️ Always run `cdk diff` before deploying to production. Review all IAM and security group changes.
